            I've always enjoyed watching people pitch their ideas. I think we live in a great time for innovation and information. A lot of the ideas seemed very doable. After taking CIT 261 I realize how important it is to have a concrete idea before you begin programming. Making something simple and useful that you finish by the end of the semester is better than creating something so complex that you don't finish and have a hard time learning.

That being said, posting an idea for an app for others to critic can be a little intimidating. However, just because we receive negative feedback doesn't mean the idea is bad. All ideas, even good ones need to evolve to become great. I'm reading a book about some of the greatest ideas to come out of our lifetime. It's very interesting to see how the innovators came up with their ideas, the failure they go through, the change, and then the final/current product. Even if your idea doesn't get chosen this semester, keep working at it in your off time. If nothing else, it will be a great learning experience.

            I can't believe we are already finishing up lesson 2. The semester is going on fast. Our group has 5 members, and I think all of our ideas are good. A lot of the teaching topics I've never learned before. I think before we select our app, it will be a good idea to briefly research them to make sure we can incorporate all of them while designing the app. Also, along with an elevator pitch, its a good idea to research everything that would be required to make your app. For example, my idea would require a web scraper, something like jsoup or learning the API of ESPN or another sports site. There is good documentation for doing it, but maybe it might be outside the scope of the course or difficult to accomplish within a few weeks. These are things that need to be examined in more detail and discussed with my group. ï»¿
